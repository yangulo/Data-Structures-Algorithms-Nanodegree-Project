# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Nanodegree-Project-2
This project solves 6 questions required to pass Data Structures Algorithms Nanodegree Project 2. It implements different data structures such as:
* Array
* linked list
* Has Maps
* Trees and so on. 

Each problem shows the code solution named as problem_X.py, unit testing named as problem_X_test.py and time &amp; space efficiency analysis named as explanation_X.md
